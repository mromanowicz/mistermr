  <h2>It all started in Amsterdam</h2>
  <p>When we reinvented email for the iPad with Visual Email. It started with the thought that hey, we're sending a lot of images to our friends as a form of communication. We also noticed that a lot of marketers we're doing the same thing to us. Outside of this, we gathered that visual culture was on the rise with the popularity of Instagram and Pinterest.</p> 
  
 <p>So we thought, wouldn't it make sense if our inboxes were a series of images to represent what was really being sent to us, instead of the normal text based sender, subject line, timestamp that we're used to.</p>

<p>Here's what people said:</p>

	  	<a href="#features"><h4>"VISUAL EMAIL HAS A GREAT USER INTERFACE AND A BOLD PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE OF EMAIL ON THE IPAD"</h4></a>	  	




<p>"If you want an email client for your iPad with more ‘oomph’ when it comes to the UI, Visual Mail might be a great option."

  <h2>I've got a new invention. It's a revolving bowl for tired goldfish.</h2>
  <p>On another project, we invented an easy way for people with little to no technical knowledge to build their own apps. We realized that the age of PowerPoint was over. Static presentations are going to the way of the dodo. An interactive well crafted narrative is the only way to tell compelling stories, and what better platform to do it on but the world's best consumption device—the iPad. So we did just that, we designed a set of tools so that whether you're an intern, or an account director, you could have your own app. We even cofounded a company around it called StoryDesk.
